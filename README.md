# DSA Solved Problems Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Solutions** repository! This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems I have solved from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and more.

## üìÅ Structure

Each solution is organized by problem name and includes the following:
- **Problem description** (if available)
- **Language**: All problems are solved using **C++**, unless otherwise specified.
- **Solution**: Optimized and tested code for each problem.
- **Explanations**: Some problems include a brief explanation of the approach used, along with comments in the code.

## üìö Topics Covered

This repository contains solutions across a wide range of DSA topics, including:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching
- Backtracking
- Recursion
- Mathematical Problems
