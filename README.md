DSA Solved Problems Repository
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Solutions repository! This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems I have solved from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and more.

üìÅ Structure
Each solution is organized by problem name and includes the following:

Problem description (if available)
Language: All problems are solved using C++, unless otherwise specified.
Solution: Optimized and tested code for each problem.
Explanations: Some problems include a brief explanation of the approach used, along with comments in the code.
üìö Topics Covered
This repository contains solutions across a wide range of DSA topics, including:

Arrays and Strings
Linked Lists
Stacks and Queues
Trees and Graphs
Dynamic Programming
Greedy Algorithms
Sorting and Searching
Backtracking
Recursion
Mathematical Problems
üîß How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-solved-problems.git
Navigate to the specific problem folder to view the solution and try it yourself:

bash
Copy code
cd dsa-solved-problems/problem-name
Run the solution using your preferred C++ compiler.
